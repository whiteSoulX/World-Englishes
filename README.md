## 📖 About The Project

This interactive web application was developed to visualize the evolution of the English language—from its origins as a dialect of Germanic tribes on a "small island" to its current status as a global lingua franca spoken by over 750 million people.

The project combines historical linguistics, sociolinguistic theories, and interactive mapping to demonstrate how English spread through three major diasporas and how new varieties (like **Banglish**) are shaping its future.

## ✨ Key Features

* **✈️ Interactive Migration Map:** A dynamic flight simulation using **Leaflet.js** that traces the spread of English from the UK to North America, Australia, and South Asia.
* **🃏 3D Vocabulary Flip Cards:** Interactive cards demonstrating the etymological roots of English words (Anglo-Saxon vs. French/Latin).
* **📊 Theoretical Frameworks:** Tabbed interfaces explaining **Kachru's Three Circles** and **Schneider's Dynamic Model**.
* **🇧🇩 Case Study: Banglish:** A dedicated section analyzing the phonology, lexis, and pragmatics of Bangladeshi English.
* **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** Includes a custom mobile hamburger menu, glassmorphism navigation, and touch-friendly layouts.
* **🎨 Modern UI/UX:** Features parallax scrolling, scroll-reveal animations, and a polished academic aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and content organization.
* **CSS3:** Advanced styling including Flexbox, Grid, 3D Transforms (Flip Cards), Animations (`@keyframes`), and Glassmorphism.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation, Scroll Observers, Tab logic, and Mobile Menu toggling.
* **Leaflet.js:** Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
* **Font Awesome:** Iconography.
* **Google Fonts:** Typography (*Playfair Display* & *Poppins*).
